#  Introduction to Variable Declaration in Python

#### Exercise Description:
In this exercise, I learned the concept of variable declaration in Python by creating a simple program to display personal details. I defined variables to store information such as my first and last name, school, country, age, city, and marital status. By using the print() function, I was able to display these variables in a formatted output. This exercise helped me understand how to store and manipulate data in Python using variables, an essential building block for programming.
